# Twitbot: A bot that posts to twitter
To see this in action visit: https://twitter.com/FulltonThe (I only ever post to this account via the bot)

## What is it?
This is a python-scripted bot that allows the user to update their twitter status and automatically like/retweet tweets based on search terms. I'm currently in the process of adding more functionality and better UI (including a GUI) to the bot.

## Build Status
In progress.

**Currently it can:**
    - Update Status (text only)
    - Search for posts given search terms
    -Like and Retweet these posts

**Currently working on adding:**
    - Allowing user to imput Status/search terms
    - Posting images
    - Posting at specific times a day
    - Sending Direct Messages
    - Commenting
    - GUI interface

## Languages Used
Python

## Motivation
People have stressed the importance of "building a social media presence" but I'd rather spend the time honing my coding skills. Not only does this program increase my skills, but it searches through tweets for me, allowing me to have my cake and eat it too.
